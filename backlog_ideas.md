## Initial improvements to be made
* Have different files within local folder that will contain additions
* have one central file that is marked up to print

* Make the ability to assign notes to categories
* Change the add command from "|a" to "add [arg1]" with arg1 being the category to assign the note to


## Way Down the Road
